<h2><a name="PUBLISHERS_PREFACE" id="PUBLISHERS_PREFACE"></a>PUBLISHER’S PREFACE</h2>

<p>The author and artist of this book are so much better known in
connection with other kinds of literary and artistic work, that a word
concerning its origin will be in order. Just before Christmas, 1897, Mr.
Willard, the artist, sent to his friend Dr. Barton twenty pencil
sketches illustrating the evolution of a pumpkin pie. Dr. Barton wrote
some verses to accompany them for his own children. They gave so much
pleasure to his little people and to others, and were enjoyed by so many
older people as well, that the author and artist have consented to give
them to other children.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a href="images/image005a.jpg">
<img src="images/image005a.jpg" width="250" alt="[Image unavailable.]" /></a>
</div>

<div class="figright">
<a href="images/image005b.jpg">
<img src="images/image005b.jpg" width="250" alt="[Image unavailable.]" /></a>
</div>

<p>Dr. Barton is well known as the author of more pretentious works in
theology, history, and fiction, and Mr. Willard is known as the painter
of “Yankee Doodle,” the most famous patriotic picture painted in this
country. His “Minute Men of the Revolution” is hardly less noted, and
not less meritorious. His comical pictures also are widely known, with
humor varying from the quiet Sunday smile that goes with “Pitching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span>
Tune,” to the rollicking, boisterous laugh belonging to “The Drummer’s
Latest Yarn.”</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a href="images/image006a.jpg">
<img src="images/image006a.jpg" width="250" alt="[Image unavailable.]" /></a>
</div>

<p>But Mr. Willard first became known to the public as a painter of
children. His first pictures to attract attention of the public were a
pair called “Pluck,” representing a homemade cart occupied by some
little folks, and drawn by a dog in hot pursuit of a rabbit. These made
their advent twenty odd years ago when the chromo was in its glory, and
found their way into thousands of homes.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a href="images/image006b.jpg">
<img src="images/image006b.jpg" width="250" alt="[Image unavailable.]" /></a>
</div>

<p>It is interesting to notice the recurrence of the theme in these
pictures. There is still a dog, and the children must be a generation
younger than those in “Pluck,” but they are the same sturdy,
industrious, plucky little people.</p>

<p>Mr. Willard’s children are always wholesome and attractive. They are
honest, happy, unspoiled little folks, full of fun and ingenuity, and
good companions for boys and girls everywhere.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
